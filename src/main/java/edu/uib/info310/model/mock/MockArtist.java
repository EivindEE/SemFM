Born in Saint Michael, Barbados, Rihanna moved to the United States at the age of 16 to pursue a recording career under the guidance of record producer Evan Rogers. She subsequently signed a contract with Def Jam Recordings after auditioning for then-label head Jay-Z.\nIn 2005, Rihanna released her debut studio album, Music of the Sun, which peaked in the top ten of the Billboard 200 chart and features the Billboard Hot 100 hit single “Pon de Replay.” Less than a year later, she released her second studio album, A Girl Like Me (2006), which peaked within the top five of the Billboard albums chart, and produced her first Hot 100 number one single, “SOS”. Rihanna’s third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), spawned four chart-topping singles “Umbrella”, “Take a Bow”, “Disturbia” and “Don’t Stop the Music”, and was nominated for nine Grammy Awards, winning Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for “Umbrella,” which features Jay-Z. Her fourth studio album Rated R, released in November 2009, produced the top 10 singles “Russian Roulette”, “Hard” and “Rude Boy”, which achieved the number-one spot on the Billboard Hot 100. Loud (2010), her fifth studio album, contains the number-one hits “Only Girl (In the World)”, “What’s My Name?” and “S&M”. “We Found Love” was released in September 2011 as the lead single from her sixth studio album, Talk That Talk, which is set to be released in November 2011.";
